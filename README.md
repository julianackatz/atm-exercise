# ATM Exercise Improvements

**Intro**

This is a ATM simulation exercise.

Professor Williams from MIT provided the initial code to start.

This code is a simulation of an ATM machine, you can simulate to deposit money and to withdraw. 

Improvements were made in order to not let the user withdraw more money than how much it has in the bank account.
